- Transport: stdio (launch with `--mcp` flag)
- Tools: 54 tools across 8 categories
- Resources: 5 resource endpoints
- Compatible with: Claude Desktop, Claude Code (CLI), Cursor, and any MCP-compatible client

### Setup

Claude Desktop: Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{ "mcpServers": { "gaze": { "command": "/Applications/Gaze.app/Contents/MacOS/Gaze", "args": ["--mcp"] } } }
```

Claude Code: Run `claude mcp add gaze -- /Applications/Gaze.app/Contents/MacOS/Gaze --mcp`

Cursor: Add to `.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{ "mcpServers": { "gaze": { "command": "/Applications/Gaze.app/Contents/MacOS/Gaze", "args": ["--mcp"] } } }
```
