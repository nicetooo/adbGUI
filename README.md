## Why Gaze?

- **Modern & Fast**: Built with Wails (Go + React), providing a native-like experience with minimal resource overhead.
- **True Self-Contained**: No need to install `adb`, `scrcpy`, `aapt`, `ffmpeg`, or `ffprobe` on your system. Everything is bundled and ready to go.
- **Reliable File Transfer**: A robust alternative to the often-flaky *Android File Transfer* on macOS.
- **Multi-Device Power**: Supports independent, simultaneous background recording for multiple devices.
- **Session-Event Architecture**: Unified tracking of all device activities (logs, network, touch, app lifecycle) on a single timeline.
- **Visual Workflow Automation**: Build complex test flows with a drag-and-drop node editor — no code required.
- **AI-Ready via MCP**: 50+ tools exposed through the Model Context Protocol for seamless integration with AI clients like Claude Desktop and Cursor.
- **Developer First**: Integrated Logcat, Shell, MITM Proxy, and UI Inspector designed by developers, for developers.

## Built-in Binaries

This application is fully self-contained. It bundles:
- **ADB** (Android Debug Bridge)
- **Scrcpy** (Screen mirroring & recording)
- **AAPT** (Android Asset Packaging Tool)
- **FFmpeg** (Video/audio processing)
- **FFprobe** (Media analysis)

At startup, these are extracted to a temporary directory and used automatically. You don't need to configure your system PATH.

## Important Notes for Xiaomi/Poco/Redmi Users

To enable **touch control** in Scrcpy, you must:
1. Go to **Developer Options**.
2. Enable **USB Debugging**.
3. Enable **USB Debugging (Security settings)**.
   *(Note: This requires a SIM card and Mi Account login on most Xiaomi devices).*

## Troubleshooting

### macOS: "App is damaged and can't be opened"
If you download the app from GitHub and see the error *"Gaze.app is damaged and can't be opened"*, this is due to macOS Gatekeeper quarantine.

To fix this, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
sudo xattr -cr /path/to/Gaze.app
```
*(Replace `/path/to/Gaze.app` with the actual path to your downloaded application)*

> **Or build it yourself:** If you prefer not to bypass Gatekeeper, you can easily [build the app from source](#getting-started) locally. It only takes a few minutes!

### Windows: "Windows protected your PC"
If you see a blue SmartScreen popup preventing the app from starting:
1. Click **More info**.
2. Click **Run anyway**.
