## 🛠️ Built-in Binaries

This application is fully self-contained. It bundles:
- **ADB** (Android Debug Bridge)
- **Scrcpy** executable
- **Scrcpy-server**

At startup, these are extracted to a temporary directory and used automatically. You don't need to configure your system PATH.

## ⚠️ Important Notes for Xiaomi/Poco/Redmi Users

To enable **touch control** in Scrcpy, you must:
1. Go to **Developer Options**.
2. Enable **USB Debugging**.
3. Enable **USB Debugging (Security settings)**. 
   *(Note: This requires a SIM card and Mi Account login on most Xiaomi devices).*

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### macOS: "App is damaged and can't be opened"
If you download the app from GitHub and see the error *"adbGUI.app is damaged and can't be opened"*, this is due to macOS Gatekeeper quarantine.

To fix this, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
sudo xattr -cr /path/to/adbGUI.app
```
*(Replace `/path/to/adbGUI.app` with the actual path to your downloaded application)*

> **Or build it yourself:** If you prefer not to bypass Gatekeeper, you can easily [build the app from source](#-getting-started) locally. It only takes a few minutes!

### Windows: "Windows protected your PC"
If you see a blue SmartScreen popup preventing the app from starting:
1. Click **More info**.
2. Click **Run anyway**.
